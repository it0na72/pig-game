<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
![piggame](https://github.com/it0na72/pig-game/assets/56265972/ad47ec06-1afd-46b3-9182-ca3bea98343c)

The Pig Game is a two-player dice game where players take turns rolling a dice and accumulate points, but if they roll a 1, they lose their current points and it becomes the next player's turn. The first player to reach a predefined winning score wins the game.
